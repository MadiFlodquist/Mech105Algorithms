# Mech105Algorithms
The algorithms in this repository were created for my Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving and Numerical Methods class. 

## Content
There were 3 algorithms which I created and are stored here. They are luFactor, falsePosition, and Simpson.
### LU Factorization
The lu factorization algorithm which decomposes a square matrix of any length into its lower and upper matrix components. 
### Simpson's 1/3 Rule
The Simpson algorithm was created to perform the composite Simpson's 1/3 rule for tabulated data not for functions. 
### False Position Root Finding Method
The false position algorithm finds the root of a function with the error of the approximation as well as the number of iterations of the method it takes to reach this root.
